        <h1>About TheOpenLawLab</h1>
        <p><strong>Open-source tools for legal aid operations.</strong></p>
        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>Our mission is to provide free, open-source, high-quality solutions for legal problems, whether broad or highly specific, created by and for the public-interest community.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Free and open source:</strong> Every project is intended to be transparent, reusable, and adaptable by legal-aid practitioners and civic technologists.</li>
          <li><strong>Quality solutions:</strong> We prioritize reliability and usability so tools are practical in real legal workflows, not just prototypes.</li>
          <li><strong>Made by anyone:</strong> Contributions are welcome from developers, legal workers, researchers, and community members with lived experience.</li>
          <li><strong>Legal aid + systems:</strong> We focus on the intersection of direct legal support and systems design, so improvements can scale and serve more people.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Mission statement</h2>
        <p>Our mission is to build open digital infrastructure that strengthens legal aid systems and improves access to justice through structural efficiency.</p>
        <h2>What we build</h2>
        <p>We focus on practical software for intake, case workflow, and client communication that can be adopted by legal organizations with minimal overhead.</p>
        <h2>Why structural efficiency matters</h2>
        <p>When legal aid teams spend less time on avoidable operational friction, they can serve more people with higher quality support.</p>
        <h2>Volunteer philosophy</h2>
        <p>Our work is volunteer-led and practitioner-informed, combining technical contributions with legal domain expertise.</p>
        <h2>Transparency commitment</h2>
        <p>We build in the open, document decisions, and publish source code so organizations can audit, adapt, and improve every project.</p>
